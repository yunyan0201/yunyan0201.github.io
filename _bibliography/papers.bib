@article{barberbrainwaves,
  title={Brainwaves, by Melissa Umphlett. Original artwork, acrylic on canvas 12 x 12 inch. In our brains, the communication between neurons is at the root of all thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This communication produces patterns of electrical activity called brainwaves that can be measured using an electroencephalogram. The waves in this piece are depicted in an ethereal but somewhat chaotic way, reflecting the ever-changing landscape of brainwaves},
